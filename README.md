# Advent of Code

My code solutions for Advent of Code, written in Python (and sometimes other languages). I might tidy up the code a bit after the fact, but the solution shown will be the one I used to solve the problem.

I have some util functions in `util/helpers.py` that I use in some of the solutions. Each year I create a `Day 0` blueprint that I copy and paste for each day.
